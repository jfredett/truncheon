# TODO: maybe this is a scripting language?
#
#
# I think this is probably just going to be a bespoke thing to represent the existing map.
#
# Maybe the Topology should really be like
#
# Maybe these should be called 'spaces' and not regions, since I'll also need a metric on these things to judge how time
# flows.
#
# OverlayTopology(Hex|Square, Origin)
#   - Represents a map like what I have in Foundry now, an image with an overlaid grid system of some kind.
# HexTopology, SquareTopology
#   - Represents a hex-coordinate topology with hexes as the primary unit, a sparse tree, indexed by some coordinate
#   system for hexes, indexes everything. Square likewise.
# PointTopology
#   - Represents a collection of locations connected point-to-point.
#
# locations contain a hash of string -> value? then the tileset can duck type itself into whatever info it needs?
# coord should be held outside the location.
#
# So location is a Hash<String, String> (that _sucks_ can I make that smarter, maybe it's a few hashmaps with supported
# types?)
